| Opérateurs | Functions |
| ---------- | --------- |
| >	         | Get JSON array element (indexed from zero, negative integers count from the end) |
| ->	       | Get JSON object field by key. |
| ->>	       | Get JSON array element as text. |
| ->>	       | Get JSON object field as text. |
| #>	       | Get JSON object at the specified path. |
| #>>	       | Get the JSON object on the specified path as text. |
| {'@>'}	   | Does the left JSON value contain the right path/value entries at the top level? |
| {'<@'}	   | Are the left JSON path/value entries at the top level within the right JSON value? |
| ?	         | Does the string exist as a top-level key within the JSON value? |
| ?|	       | Do any of these array strings exist as top-level keys? |
| ?&	       | Do all of these array strings exist as top-level keys? |
| ||	       | Concatenate two JSONB values into a new JSONB value. |
| –	         | Delete key/value pair or string element from the left operand. Key/value pairs are matched based on their key value. |
| –	         | Delete multiple key/value pairs or string elements from the left operand. Key/value pairs are matched based on their key value. |
| –	         | Delete the array element with the specified index (Negative integers count from the end). It throws an error if the top-level container is not an array. |
| #-	       | Delete the field or element with the specified path (for JSON arrays, negative integers count from the end) |
| @?	       | Does the JSON path return any item for the specified JSON value? |
